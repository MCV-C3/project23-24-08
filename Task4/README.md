# C3. Image Classification

## Folder structure 
The code and data is structured as follows:

        .
        ├── train2.py                 # Source code
        ├── Pretrain.ipynb            # Pretraining of the model
        └── utils.py                        



## Requirements
Standard Computer Vision python packages are used. Regarding the python version, Python >= 3.9 is needed.

- OpenCV / cv2: $pip install opencv-python
- Tqdm: $pip installl tqdm
- Pickle: $pip install pickle5
- Sklearn: $pip install -U scikit-learn
- TensorFlow: $pip install tensorflow


## Usage
Some code is in .ipynb format, thus it is required to have Jupyter Notebook or any other program/text editor that can run this kind of file. We recommend using Visual Studio Code with the Jupyter extension.

To replicate the submitted results and ensure that everything works as expected, simply use the Run all button (or run the code blocks from top to bottom).

## Tasks
The main objective of this lab was to design a CNN and train it from scrach. To evaluate the model, its size and accuracy is taken into account with a ratio. Moreover, the aim was to put everything learned togheter, control the pipeline and make decisions about it.
